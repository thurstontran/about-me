        <h1>More About Me</h1>
        <p> I am currently studying Web Development at Humber College and recently graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Digital Media. 
        Some hobbies I like to do on my free time is to play video games. I also enjoy spending quality time with my friends and family.
        During my Bachelor's, I collaborated with other students to develop a video-game prototype titled <a href="https://thurstontran.itch.io/dusk-looms">Dusk Looms</a>.
        Another project I worked on is a <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/thurstontran/full/fPPf_zR1u">Music Visualizer</a>, primarily using a JavaScript library called <em>p5.js</em> with the goal of making interactive experiences.</p>
